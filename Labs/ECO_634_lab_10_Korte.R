#Q2- Examine the conditional boxplot in the Partitioning Variance: Within-Group section of the walkthrough.
#Based on the figure, do you think there are equal variances among the groups?
    #Based on the figure, I donâ€™t think there are equal variances among the groups.
    #The rope type boxes visually have widely-varying heights from each other.

#Q3- Conduct a Bartlett test to assess the homogeneity of variances of the percent cut among the rope type groups. Report the p-value.
bartlett.test(p.cut ~ rope.type, data = rope)
    
#Q4- Given your graphical assessment and the Bartlett test, do you think an ANOVA-type analysis is appropriate on the raw data? Explain why or why not.
 #No, ANOVA assumes contant varaible and p-value was <0.05, so I can reject the null hypothesis of equal variance among the groups.

#Q6- What is the mean percent cut of the base case rope? 
  #It is 0.36714. doesn't require any calculation, since the intercept coefficient is interpreted as the intercept mean but I here is the calculation anyway.
